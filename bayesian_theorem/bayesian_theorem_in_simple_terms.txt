Bayesian theorem is a conditional probability theory:

P(X|Y) = ( P(Y|X) * P(X) ) / P(Y), which is Posterior = ( Likelihood * Prior ) /  Evidence

Let's say we have:

    - 100 cars that are Ford, and:
        - 20 are truck 
        - 30 are two door
        - 50 are four door
    - 200 cars are Toyota, and:
        - 150 are four door
        - 30 are two door
        - 20 are truck
        
And let's say we want to calculate P(Ford|four door).

So according to Bayesian Theorem:

P(Ford|four door) = (P(four door|Ford) * P(Ford)) / P(four door).

let's get into each item on the right side of the equation:

    - P(four door|Ford)： given that this is a Ford, what's the probability that it's four door?
      Answer: 50/100 = 0.5
      
    - P(Ford): probability that the car is a Ford?
      Answer: 100/(100+200) = 1/3
      
    - P(four door): probability that the car is a four door car
      Answer: (50 + 150) / (100 + 200) = 2/3
     
Now let's calcuate the probability:

P(Ford|four door) = (P(four door|Ford) * P(Ford)) / P(four door)
                  = 0.5 * 1/3 * 2/3
                  = 1/9
                  
Here, P(Ford|four door) is called **Posterior**,
P(four door|Ford) is **Likelihood**,
P(Ford) is **Prior**,
P(four door) is **Evidence**.


Now let’s see why they are called like that.

Posterior: After we observed it’s a four door, we know something about the object. Because it’s post(or after) the observation, 
we call it posterior: P(Ford|four door).

Likelihood: The dictionary meaning of this word is chance or probability that one thing will happen. Here it means when it’s a movie,
what the chance will be if it is also a four door. This term is very important in Machine Learning.

Prior: Before we observe it’s a four door, the object is completely unknown to us. Our goal is to find out the possibility that
it’s a Ford, we actually have the data prior(or before) our observation, which is the possibility that it’s a Ford if it’s
a completely unknown object: P(Ford).

Evidence: Because we’ve already known it’s a four door, what has happened is happened. We witness it’s appearance, so to us, it’s
an evidence, and the chance we get this evidence is P(four door).

So why those probabilities are named like that, the observation time is a very important reason.
